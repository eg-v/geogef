Geography Teaching System

Welcome to the repository of our Geography Teaching System project!

Project Description

This project aims to develop a geography teaching application that will be based on a leveling system to gradually increase difficulty. 
Inspired by the learning method used in Duolingo, the application will provide interactive lessons designed to make geography learning accessible, engaging, and effective. 
Users will progress through different levels, each with a progressively challenging curriculum.

Key Features

Interactive Lessons: Users will engage in interactive lessons that utilize a leveling system to increase the challenge as they advance in their learning. 
Educational Games: We will integrate educational games to make learning more dynamic and entertaining, adapting to each user's difficulty level. 
Customization: The application will allow users to personalize their learning experience according to their interests and knowledge level, offering tailored lessons to their individual needs. 
Multimedia Resources: We will include multimedia resources such as images, videos, and audio to enrich the educational content and make learning more interactive and engaging.
